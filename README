This package contains the source code for building the Transcendence.exe client,
which is used to run any Transcendence adventure, including "Domina & Oracus".

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Use Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 or later. You may need to install the DirectX
SDK (although the latest versions of MVS include it).

Select the Transcendence project as the StartUp project and build. The
executables will be placed in the Transcendence/Game directory.

For security reasons the source code does not include certain files to 
communicate with the Hexarc arcology (the cloud service). The code will compile
without it, however, as long as you add CHexarcServiceStub.cpp to the build.

In Visual Studio, find the CHexarcServiceStub.cpp file in the TSUI project under
the CloudInterface folder. Bring up the Properties page for the file and under
General properties set "Exclude from Build" to "No".
