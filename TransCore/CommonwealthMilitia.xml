	<!-- Commonwealth Militia

	This type holds all global data and events for the Commonwealth Militia
	occupation.

	GLOBAL DATA

	rank: The player's current rank. The following values are defined:

			Nil:		Civilian				Never successfully completed a mission
			1			Lieutenant				Completed at least one mission
			2			Major
			3			Colonel

			-1			Player has failed too many missions

	ATTRIBUTES

	commonwealthMilitia: MissionTypes with this attribute are considered part of the
			Commonwealth Militia cycle; they will be included in the final tally of
			missions succeeded/failed.

	rank?: This family of attributes includes all valid Commonwealth Militia ranks:
			(rank1, rank2, rank3, and rank0). The player will only be offered missions
			appropriate to their own rank. rank0 indicates the mission is available
			to civilians.

			A MissionType may have multiple rank attributes.

			A mission must have both the commonwealthMilitia and atleast one rank
			attribute to be offered at a Commonwealth Fortress. Special missions may
			omit the rank attribute if they are offered in another way.
