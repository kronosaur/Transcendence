<!-- CHARACTER SCREEN ==========================================================

	USAGE

	The object (generally a ship) with this screen must set the character 
	parameter on the class.

	The object must also define the following language elements:

		core.firstIntro
		core.intro
		core.noMissions

	The character type must define the following static data elements:

		MissionAttribute: A string representing the attribute to use for all 
				missions that may be assigned by the character.

	The character type must define the following events:

		OnCharacterCanBeMet: If handled, the event may return True to indicate
				that the meeting should continue. Or the event may return a
				string to display declining the meeting.

<!-- GLOBAL FUNCTIONS ==========================================================

	USAGE

	These functions use the following global variables on character types:

	firstPlayerMeetingTime: Tick of player's first meeting with character.
			Nil if the player has never met face to face.

	lastestPlayerMeetingTime: Tick of most recent meeting with character.

	lastNodeID: Character's last known position. Nil means unknown.

	lastSystemPos: Character's last known position in the lastNodeID system.

	objID: The objID of character's current ship. If Nil, then no ship has
			been created yet.

	playerRel: If Nil, character has never met the player. Positive numbers mean that
			character likes/trusts/respects the player. Negative numbers mean the
			opposite.

	screenData: This is a structure specifying the screen to show when the player
			interacts with the character. The struct has the following fields:

			screen: The screen to show
			pane: If non-Nil, the pane to navigate to
			data: If non-Nil, data to pass to the screen

			If this value is Nil, then we look for missions tagged with 
			character mission attribute (e.g., kateMorgentalMission).

			;	STATION CHARACTER PERSONAS -------------------------------------
			;
			;	This set of functions are used to manage random NPC on various

			;	giver on a station.
			;
			;	USAGE
			;
			;	1.	Generate a CharacterTable in a StaticData block in one or 
			;		more types. A CharacterTable is a struct with one field per
			;		character ID. Each field is a struct containing information
			;		about the character.
			;
			;		For example:
			;
			;		{
			;			lukeSkywalker: {
			;				id: 'lukeSkywalker
			;				fullName: "Luke Skywalker"
			;				friendlyName: "Luke"
			;				formalName: "Skywalker"

			;			}
			;
			;	2.	Call rpgCharacterAssignRandom in the OnCreate for a given
			;		station. You must call this once for each role used by the
			;		station. For example, if you have a station master and a
			;		bartender who both give out missions, you need two calls.
			;
			;	3.	Use rpgCharacterTranslate to get specific text for the 
			;		randomly chosen character.
