<!-- MEMBERSHIP

	This module defines some helpers for implementing membership in an organization
	with experience points and ranks.

	REQUIREMENTS

	The membership type (usually the sovereign) must have the following elements:

	RankTable (StaticData): We expect this to be a struct of ranks, indexed by ranks
		(starting at 1), and containing an xpNeeded field.

	rpg.descPromotion: This series of language elements should define the
		text shown to the player when they are promoted to a given rank (starting
		at 2). The rank is passed in gData in the rank field.

	DATA

	rpg.rank: We store the player's current rank.

	rpg.xp: This is the player's current XP.
