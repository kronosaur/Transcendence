				The Ares has asked you to test the Iocrym strengths and weaknesses by
				destroying one of their outposts.

				Payment: None

			<Text id="Intro">

				An Ares scientist comes forward:

				"Welcome, Human! It is good that we can meet under peaceful circumstances.
				Like you, we are studying the Iocrym, for they are as much a threat to us
				as they are to you."

			</Text>
			<Text id="Briefing">

				"Our forescouts have detected a hidden Iocrym outpost inside the
				quarantine zone. We ask that you destroy it so that we may understand
				its strengths and weaknesses. Do you wish to accept this request?"

			<Text id="AcceptReply">

				"You are strong, Human! We will repay your efforts by sharing all data
				that we collect.

				"On Ares we would say, 'May you find water,' but in your honor, Human,
				we say 'Good luck'"

			<Text id="DeclineReply">

				"Your weakness discredits your race! Return later if you wish to

			<Text id="SuccessDebrief">

				"Good fortune, Human! Based on your encounter with the Iocrym outpost we
				have analyzed their defenses. Although their technology is far beyond
				ours, they are not invincible. They are particularly vulnerable to
				antimatter weapons.
				
				"As promised, here is a ROM that contains the data we've gathered."

				An Ares scientist comes forward:

				"Welcome, Human! We are studying the Iocrym just as you are now. Return
				here when your task is complete and perhaps we can help each other."
