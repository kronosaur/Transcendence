				"As I said, the Sung have found us. A single Dragon slaver, the most
				powerful of the Sung weapons, has entered the system and is hunting
				for the location of our temple. You felt the Dragon's claw in your
				dream, did you not? Stay and help us! I don't know what path the Light
				has planned for you, but perhaps you will know after you have defeated
				the invader."
