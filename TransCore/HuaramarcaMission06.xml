				coffins, all connected together and to a vast array of optical computers.

				"Not all slaves can be freed from the Sung's enslavement. Some are lost to us

				"The damaged archcannon you found on the slaver's wreck can be repaired by
				these poor souls."

			<Text id="RepairArchcannon3">
				You bring the archcannon to the slave chamber. You hear a cacophony of voices
				rise up from the slave coffins. A laser lattice envelops the archcannon and the
				computer displays flash blueprints and diagnostics. Robot hands expertly repair
				the device.
				
				When the work is finished, the voices die away in a bittersweet tone of satisfaction.
