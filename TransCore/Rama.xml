				Rama pauses for a long time, and when he speaks it is in a whisper:

				"When I became a man, I went to see a monk about my future.
				He told me that I was destined to die on a journey to the Core."

				And then, Rama laughs and dispatches the rest of his drink.

				"But I no longer fear my destiny. I will go with you!"

				As you get up to leave, Rama grabs your arm and says,
				"Perhaps we will see each other again."

				You talk to Rama, a silver-haired pilot who seems to be wearing 
				blaster armor under his flight-suit.

				You trade stories about flying and fighting, but when you mention 
				your journey to the Core, he grows quiet and stares off into space.

				Rama talks about his ship instead:
				
				"I've made a lot of modifications to her over the years. You 
				should see her in a fight: fast and tight as a lightship, but 
				heavily armed.
				
				"She's saved my life a hundred times."
