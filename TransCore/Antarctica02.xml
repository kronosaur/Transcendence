	<!-- Antarctica mission ====================================================

	EXTRA DATA

	gateID:			ID of gate leading to SK
	onDockScreen:	If true then show mission screen on docking

	GLOBAL DATA
	
	status:

		Nil: mission has not started yet.

		'underAttack: The Antarctica is under attack by the Aquilas.

		'enemy: The player has attacked the Antarctica (before, during, or 
				after the Aquala attack).

		'friend: The Aquilas have been destroyed. 
		
				NOTE: For now we reach this state whether or not the player 
				actually helped. In the future we might want to have a different
				state if the player doesn't actually help. [Or maybe not: we
				should design the mission so that the Antarctica only survives
				if the player helps.]

	NOTES

	There are multiple variables holding state for this particular mission:

	1.	The mission itself has a global variable called status, which tracks the
		current state of the mission. This status variable is only used while
		the mission is active.

	2.	The CSC Antarctica object has a data variable called behavior, which
		tracks the ship's current behavior. This variable is independent of the
		mission status. For example, the behavior might be 'leaving, which means
		the Antarctica is heading for a gate, but the mission status explains
		WHY the ship is leaving.

	3.	The character object (unidCaptainHelios) tracks the character status
		relationship with respect to the player. This state variable records 
		what happened to the Antarctica at the end:

		'destroyed: The Antarctica was destroyed by the Aquilas (not the player).

		'destroyedByPlayer: The Antarctica was destroyed by the player after the
				player sided with Admiral Decker.

		'betrayed: The player helped the Antarctica, got the reward, and then
				destroyed the Antarctica anyway.


	Outside of this mission, you may use the following checks to determine what
	happened:

		If the mission was completed successfully, then it means the Antarctica
		has escaped.

		Otherwise, the character object describes what happened.

				Captain Helios has met with the Ares to discuss a possible truce.

			</Text>
			<Text id="Intro">
				As you enter the docking bay you are surrounded by heavily armed soldiers.
				A Fleet officer approaches you and motions to the troops:

				"Take %him% to the captain."

				Across the landing bay you see the insignia of the CSC Antarctica.
			</Text>
			<Text id="textBriefing1">
				You enter the captain's chambers and stand before a striking woman with
				silver hair and dark eyes. She looks up from a holochart as you enter
				and frowns:

				"Has Admiral Decker sent you to kill us?"

			<String id="actionNoIdea">"I have [n]o idea what you're talking about."</String>
			<Text id="textBriefing2a">
				She looks away for a moment and then dismisses the Fleet officer
				and the troops. She continues after they're gone:

				"I did betray the Fleet. And I'll never be forgiven&mdash;I know that.
				You of all people must know what it's like to betray those you love
				for a greater calling."
			</Text>
			<Text id="textBriefing2b">
				She dismisses the troops. Then:

				"You're a Fleet officer! Are you trying to tell me that you've never
				heard of the Antarctica? You're either here to help or to kill us all!
				Maybe it doesn't matter either way..."
			</Text>
			<Text id="textBriefing3">
				"Three months ago we received a coded signal. It was from the Ares.
				Or at least from some faction of the Ares. They offered to negotiate
				a truce with us."

				"Decker refused&mdash;he thought it was a trap. But I wasn't so sure."
			</Text>
			<Text id="textBriefing4">
				She pauses for a long while. Then she continues:

				"After we left the Fleet, I met the Ares here in the Dantalion system.
				I have a message to take back with me to St. Katharine's. Unless, of
				course, you want to try to stop us."
			</Text>

				Just as you're about to say something, the Fleet officer barges in:

				"Forgive me, captain, we've picked up new sensor readings.

			<Text id="textAccept3">
				Calmly, the captain turns to the Fleet officer:

				"Go to condition 1 and set a direct course for the stargate."

			<Text id="textAccept4">
				Then, putting a hand on your shoulder, the captain says:

				"I know that your path lies elsewhere and that your journey
