			<!-- MISSION COMPLETE -->

			<OnCanDebrief>

				;	After the mission has completed (successfully or not) we 
				;	call this event to see if we are ready to debrief. The event
				;	can return true to indicate that a debrief should proceed
				;	as normal, or it can return a text string to display to the
				;	player explaining why debriefing cannot happen yet.

				;	to complete some task (e.g., dock) before debriefing.
