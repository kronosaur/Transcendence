			<!-- INTRO -->

			<Text id="descIntro1">
			
				You enter the brightly lit central garden of the New Victoria 
				University Hospital. Recovering patients sit on articulated 
				gurneys, while doctors and medtechs pass through, heads buried 
				in datapads.
							
				Nearby, Fiona rests at a bench, hooked up to a medical bot:
							
				"I'm glad to finally meet you. Thank you for saving my life in 
				%systemName%."
			
			</Text>
			<String id="actionIntro1">"[D]o you remember what happened?"</String>
			<Text id="descIntro2">
			
				Fiona looks around and engages a privacy screen.
							
				"Look, I don't know you, OK? Thanks again, but everything is fine."

			</Text>
			<String id="actionIntro2">"[B]enedict is worried about you."</String>
			<Text id="descIntro3">
			
				Fiona blinks tears away and looks down.
							
				"You don't want to get involved, OK?"
							
				She pauses for a long time, but seeing your persistence she 
				shakes her head and sighs. A fresh scar curves under her left 
				eye and disappears behind her ear.

			</Text>
			<Text id="descIntro4">
			
				"A few months ago, one of our medical ships, the Hand of Solace,
				was ambushed and wrecked by marauders. Sister Elana Ston was in 
				command at the time, and she survived along with a medtech. 
				Later, the medtech was found dead&mdash;blasted, actually.
							
				"Sister Ston thought the medtech might have been involved with 
				the marauders and then betrayed by them."

			</Text>
			<String id="actionIntro4">"[A] medtech in league with marauders?"</String>
			<Text id="descIntro5">
			
				"Yeah, I know it doesn't make sense, OK? But I couldn't find 
				any other explanation. And the Hand of Solace was gone, so there 
				was no evidence.
							
				"But then I got a strange message."

			</Text>
			<String id="actionIntro5">"[L]et me guess, Stormhound, right?"</String>
			<Text id="descIntro6">

				Fiona arches an eyebrow, impressed.
							
				"Yes! He said it wasn't marauders. He told me to look for the 
				wreckage of the medical ship in the %systemName% system. Asked 
				to tell him what I found.
							
				"But I never got there. Penitents attacked me on my way and 
				here I am."
			
			</Text>
			<String id="actionIntro6">"[W]ho knows about this? Benedict?"</String>
			<Text id="descIntro7">

				Fiona stares at you.
							
				"No. Not yet. Stormhound told me about his past. I'm questioning 
				everything, OK?"
			
			</Text>
			<String id="actionIntro7A">"[Y]ou can trust Benedict."</String>
			<String id="actionIntro7B">"[D]on't trust Benedict."</String>
			<Text id="descIntro8">
			
				Fiona closes her eyes and smiles.
							
				"I want to believe that, OK? I really do. But I can't take the 
				chance that I'm wrong."
			
			</Text>
			<String id="actionIntro8">"[W]hat do we do now?"</String>
			<Text id="descIntro9">

				Fiona closes her eyes and frowns.
							
				"I don't know anymore. But either way, I can't take the chance 
				that he's turned."
