				Help stations in the system to investigate Iocrym technology.

			<Text id="Intro">

				Kate Morgental and her team from the Svalbard Explorer are setting up
				a research base here. Their goal is to understand how to break the Iocrym
				quarantine.

			</Text>
			<Text id="Briefing">

				Kate Morgental approaches you:

				"It looks like the Iocrym know that we're here. We've been monitoring the
				outer system and we've detected Iocrym activity. We think they are
				planning to attack us&mdash;but we don't know what their target will be.
				Stay sharp: we'll send a message out to you if anything happens."

			</Text>
			<Text id="textResearch">

				You tell Kate Morgental that you have research data on the Iocrym. She
				and her team are happy:

				"That's wonderful&mdash;we'll analyze the data and see if it can help us
				to break the Iocrym quarantine. Wait here while we take a look."

			</Text>
			<Text id="textResearchThanks">

				"Thank you! The data that your provided is very useful. We are closer to
				understanding how the quarantine works, but we still don't know how to
				disable it. If you can get us more data, that would help a lot."

			</Text>
			<Text id="textResearchComplete">

				"That's it! That's the missing piece! With all the data you've gathered
				we now understand how the Iocrym have created the quarantine. The event
				horizon that keeps us from leaving will collapse as soon as we disable
				the Iocrym manipulators deployed around the Heretic sun."

			</Text>
			<Text id="textDisableManipulators1">

				"All of the Iocrym manipulators are controlled from this position. We
				should be able to order the manipulators to shut down&mdash;that will
				break the quarantine! Stand by..."

			</Text>
			<Text id="textDisableManipulators2">

				Kate Morgental's team connects their equipment to the alien machinery.
				They issue commands and the alien symbols around the chamber begin to
				flash in unison. Suddenly, the omnipresent hum of gigantic machinery
				changes pitch and begins to die down.

			</Text>
			<Text id="textDisableManipulators3">

				"We've done it! The quarantine is broken! I'll get a message to St.
				Kat's&mdash;this is a historic moment for the human race!"

				"Now you're free to continue your journey to the Core. Thanks for your
				help, %name%. We couldn't have done it without you. I hope to see you
				again someday."

			</Text>
			<Text id="textFindResearch1">

				Kate Morgental approaches you:

				"Good to see you again! We're making progress, but we need more data.
				Fortunately, we've identified a wreck in the system that has the research
				data we need. Will you go retrieve it?"

			</Text>
			<Text id="textFindResearch2">

				"Thanks. We've programmed the location of the wreck into your computer.
				Find the wreck and bring the data it contains back to us."

			</Text>
			<Text id="textWaitForResearch">

				Kate Morgental approaches you. She looks tired and frustrated:

				"It's no use! We don't have enough data to figure out how to disable the
				quarantine. And the other research stations have either been destroyed or
				come up with nothing. Our only hope is to catch a break from some Iocrym
				hardware. Maybe we can salvage some data out of the wreck of an Iocrym
				sentinel."

			</Text>
			<Text id="textMoreResearchNeeded">

				Kate Morgental and her researchers are studying the alien machinery.
				She approaches:

				"We're slowly making progress, but we need more data. Go talk to the
				other stations in the system and see if they have any research data that
				might help us."
