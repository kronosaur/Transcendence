			<Text id="textSummary">

				Professor Dall has asked you to search for an alien sphere on a Sung freighter lost in the outer system.

				System: %systemName%\n
				Payment: %payment%

			</Text>

			<!-- INTRO -->

			<Text id="dallWelcome">

				You meet one of the faculty members of the Taikon School:
				
				"I'm Professor Dall. Who are you? An explorer? A mercenary? Well, it doesn't matter to me."
				
				"I need you to fetch something for me; something that's been lost for a long time but now I've found.
				You may have to fight for it, of course, but I'm sure you're used to that, right?"

			</Text>
			<Text id="dallWelcomePilgrim">

				You meet one of the faculty members of the Taikon School:
				
				"I'm Professor Dall. Who are you? Another pilgrim? Many pass through here, always searching but not finding.
				But I can help you, if you help me in turn."
				
				"I need you to fetch something for me; something that's been lost for a long time but now I've found.
				You may have to fight for it, of course, but I'm sure you're used to that.
				And it'll be nothing compared to what you're going to have to face, am I right?"

			</Text>

			<!-- BRIEFING -->

			<Text id="dallBriefingFirst">

				"I'm looking for a very special cargo on a wrecked freighter out beyond Fulgent.
				Two-hundred years ago the Huari found a magnificent object; an alien sphere left behind by who knows what race.
				When the Sung arrived the Huari records were lost and with it the sphere. But according to a cryptic Sung memo,
				it was found again; a freighter carrying the prize was dispatched to Jiang's Star, but it never arrived."

				"Now I'm the only one who knows where the freighter ended up. And I can tell you how to find it!"

			</Text>
			<Text id="dallBriefing">

				Professor Dall greets you:

				"So you're back! Couldn't get stories of freighters carrying treasure out of your mind, am I right?
				Well I'm still willing to help you if you fetch the artifact for me. Once they see what I've found they'll
				have to pay attention!"

				"What do you say?"

			</Text>
			<Text id="dallShieldCheck">

				"You are ready for combat are you not? I mean, I don't want to trust this discovery
				to an unready ship or captain."

				"I expect a ship to need level 5 shields or higher to survive the dangers at the
				edge of the system. I hope you're prepared."

			<String id="dallBetterShip">

				"You're back! Hopefully you're ready for the mission now."

			</String>

			<!-- ACCEPT -->

			<Text id="AcceptReply">

				"I've made the calculations dozens of times; I'm sure of it. I've programmed the
				location of the freighter into your computer. All you have to do is bring back the
				sphere. I'd go myself, but I wouldn't do well in combat."

				"Good luck!"

			</Text>

			<!-- DECLINE -->

			<Text id="dallDeclineReply">
				The professor looks down at his papers.

				"Well, I don't expect you to believe me. But I know it's out there.
				It's out there and I'm going to find it. Twenty years I've spent looking;
				twenty years of calculations and research! I won't stop now."
			</Text>
			<Text id="dallComebackWhenReady">

				"I've waited for twenty years, I can wait a bit longer.
				Come back when your ship is ready for the mission."

			</Text>

			<!-- IN PROGRESS -->

			<Text id="dallInProgress">

				"Did you find it? I'm sure those are the right coordinates!
				It has to be there. You have to go out there and keep looking!"

			</Text>

			<!-- SUCCESS -->

			<Text id="dallSuccess">

				"It's beautiful! Twenty years of research and now I finally have proof!
				Be careful with it! I've got a containment vessel ready for it. You didn't
				damage it did you? Good!"
				
				"As promised, I have something to help you. I've created an
				experimental auton that will explore an entire star system all
				by itself. Go and try it out!"

			</Text>

			<!-- FAILURE -->

			<Text id="dallSphereDestroyed">

				"You fool! That sphere had survived for millions of years and 
				you managed to destroy it in a lazy afternoon! Do you even realize
				what you've done!?

				"I should have gone out there myself..."
			
			</Text>
			<Text id="dallSphereDonated">

				"You fool! That sphere was the key to unlimited power and you
				handed it to bunch of crazy superstitious witches!

				"I should have never trusted you..."

			<!-- EPILOGUE -->

			<Text id="dallAftermath">

				You find Professor Dall working in his lab. The sphere is inside a massive
				containment vessel connected through hundreds of wires to a bank of instruments.
				The professor looks up for only a moment:

				"Yes, I'm making progress, but there are millions of pathways...
				There is so much left to understand... and the power curves are immense; you
				should see them..."
