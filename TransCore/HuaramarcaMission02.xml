			</Text>
			<Text id="Summary">
			</Text>
			<Text id="Intro1">
				The doors to the Grand Hall open and a short man approaches you.

				"Welcome, friend, my name is Apotamo. You have journeyed long and rested
				little. I fear I offer only more of the same."
			</Text>
			<Text id="Intro2">
				"After the Sung stole our worlds and after we retreated to our refuge,
				the High Priest of this temple prophesied that all we had lost we would
				one day regain. He said one day a %man% would appear and %he% would lead
				us to our redemption in the realm of the Light."

				"And now, when almost all hope is lost, you appear."
			</Text>
			<Text id="Intro3">
				"Our refuge has at last been discovered by the Sung and even now they
				prepare to exterminate us. Is it possible you and your lonely ship have
				been called here to finally deliver us?"

				"There is one way to find out."
			</Text>
			<Text id="Intro4">
				"The Light speaks to us all. And if we don't always hear Him, it only is
				because our minds are so busy talking."

				Apotamo touches your shoulder and you feel a sharp pain. You see a small
				needle in his hand.

				"Don't worry, you will not be harmed. Let's see what the Light has to say to you."
			</Text>
			<Text id="Intro5">
				The temple walls glow and shift with amazing colors and you hear a distant
				music so beautiful that you fall to your knees in gratitude. A profound
				peace envelops you and your consciousness fades into a pinhole of light.

				Slowly you wake up and find yourself beneath the wide open skies of a beautiful
				planet. Though you have never been to Earth you recognize it immediately.
			</Text>
			<Text id="AcceptReply">
				You wake and find yourself on the floor of the Huari temple.
				Apotamo looks down at you, a concerned look on his face.

				"I'm sorry I had to put you through that, but I had to know. You are not
				the Solti. Your worries are about this world, not the realm of the Light."

				"But the Light did speak to you, did He not? Perhaps your destiny is
				still intertwined with ours."
			</Text>
			<Text id="SuccessMsg"></Text>

			<Text id="dreamStart">
				You are in a mountain valley beneath bright blue skies. A path
				in front of you climbs up the mountain face. Behind you a river
				flows along the valley floor.
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamCaveMouth">
				You are on a steep path climbing up the mountain. To your right
				you see the mouth of dark cave.
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamRuinsGate">
				The mountain path levels out to a small plateau. To the left you
				see a stone archway leading to ancient ruins. In front of you
				the path continues to the peak.
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamPeak">
				Lightheaded and winded, you reach the peak. From here you see a
				small village far below you, nestled in the valley floor. As you
				watch, an army of bandits appears and rides towards the
				defenseless village.
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamRuins">
				You are inside ancient stone ruins. A stone building is in front
				of you. To the right you see stairs leading into darkness.
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamAltar">
				Inside the building you see a tall, robed man standing before a
				bound girl lying on a stone altar. The man holds up a golden
				knife and exclaims: "God of the Sun, deliver us from the evil
				that threatens our village!"
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamCatacombs">
				You are inside a burial chamber for great war heroes. All are
				dressed in their finest armor. All are forgotten by the	living.
				One of the faces looks familiar. He turns to you and says,
				"Your turn!"
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamT1">
				You are in a damp and narrow cavern. A path leads to the left;
				another leads to the right.
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamT2">
				You are in great chamber of quartz. A path leads to the left;
				another leads to the right.
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamT3">
				You are in a damp cavern dimly lit by glowing lichen. A path
				leads to the left; another leads to the right.
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamT4">
				You are in a wide cavern filled with stalactites. A path leads
				to the left; another leads to the right.
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamT5">
				You are in a small chamber with a cold and clear pool. A path
				leads to the left; another leads to the right.
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamPrecipice">
				You stand before a deep pit. Inside you see the decomposed remains
				of hundreds of villagers. As you turn away, the ground gives way
				and you fall into the pit.
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamLair">
				You smell a foul stench and hear a deep growl.

				A roar startles you and pain grabs your body as steel claws rip
				your flesh. The last thing you see is the glowing maw of a titanic
				dragon.
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamVillage">
				The river path comes to a small village. The villagers ignore you
				as they hurriedly barricade their doors and close their windows.
				There is a temple in the center of the village. To the right a
				path leads to a fortress on a hill.
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamTemple">
				You enter a stone temple. A door to the left leads to the Chamber
				of the Moon; the one to the right leads to the Chamber of the Sun.
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamMoonRoom">
				You are in a dark and silent chamber. Moonlight pours in through a
				window and illuminates the figure of a priest.

				The priest is covered in blood and clutching a wooden shield
				tightly. He stares at you and says, "They need your help."
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamSunRoom">
				You are in a bright chamber. Sunlight pours in through a window
				and illuminates the figure of a priest.

				The priest is covered in blood and wielding a metal sword. He
				hands you the sword says, "I left some for you!"
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamFortress">
				You enter the fortress; there are barracks in front of you. Behind
				you there is a look-out tower.
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamBarracks">
				The barracks are filled with soldiers sharpening their swords. One
				of them turns to you and says, "Where's your sword, pilgrim? Did you
				leave it in the temple?" The rest of the men laugh uproariously.
			</Text>
			<Text id="dreamTower">
				You climb the tower. Out the window you see an army of bandits
				riding towards the village. The lead bandit sees you and yells,
				"You'll be the last to die, pilgrim, but the first to suffer!"
