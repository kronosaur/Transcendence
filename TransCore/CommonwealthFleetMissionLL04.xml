	<!-- Mission: Lamplighter Prototype Lost ===================================

	If the Lamplighter prototype has not been returned to Point Juno, then the
	Admiral has more important things to worry about, so block other missions.

	Uses a short expire time so we don't have to worry about checking if the
	player has backtracked and recovered the prototype.
