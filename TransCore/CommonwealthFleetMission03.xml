	<!-- Mission: Intercept Ares patrol ========================================

	This mission seems very easy. In testing the CSC killed most of the targets
	Consider:
		Reducing the distance which the ares approch
		More targets / a few heacy gunships
		Assigning a lead ship, with the other ares escorting it
		Stopping the CSC or escorts from helping so much

	EXTRA DATA

	reward:			Reward (in credits) for completing mission
	missionXP:		XP awarded for completing mission
	targetID:		The target to recon
