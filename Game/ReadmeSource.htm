		<h1>Welcome to Transcendence!</h1>
		<p>Transcendence has been designed to be easily extended and modified by interested 
			players. At this time, the documentation and infrastructure for these 
			modifications are very limited. Nevertheless, we encourage you to look at the 
			source game definitions and experiment at will.</p>
		<p>The <a href="http://www.neurohack.com/transcendence/forums/">Transcendence Forums</a> are a great place to ask questions about game 
			modifications.</p>
		<p>For more information on the game and to download the latest version, visit the <A href="http://www.neurohack.com/transcendence">
				Transcendence</A> page online.</p>
		<h2>Intallation Instructions</h2>
		<p>Place the Transcendence.xml file in the same folder as the rest of the game.</p>
		<h2>Caveats, Warnings, and Disclaimers</h2>
		<p>Transcendence is still in development and it is very likely that the data 
			formats in Transcendence.xml will change in future releases. Any changes or 
			modifications may or may not be compatible with future versions.</p>
		<p>You may freely distribute modified versions of Transcendence.xml for 
			non-commercial use via any mechanism you desire (e.g., email, web site, etc.) 
			with no conditions, as long as you do not include Transcendence.exe.</p>
		<p>You may distribute modified versions of Transcendence.xml and unmodified 
			versions of Transcendence.exe (and associated files) for non-commercial use, as
