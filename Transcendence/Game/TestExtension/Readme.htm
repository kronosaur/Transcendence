<h1>Welcome to Transcendence!</h1>

<p>Transcendence has been designed to be easily extended and modified by interested
players. At this time, the documentation and infrastructure for these modifications
are very limited. Nevertheless, we encourage you to look at the source game definitions
and experiment at will.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.neurohack.com/transcendence/forums/">Transcendence Forums</a> are a great place to ask questions about
game modifications.</p>

<p>For more information on the game and to download the latest version, visit
the <A href="http://www.neurohack.com/transcendence">Transcendence</A> page online.</p>

<h2>Intallation Instructions</h2>

<p>Place the files of this .zip in a folder named "Extensions" under the game folder. When successfully installed, the item and ship contained described in Test.xml will appear in the game. In particular, the test ship will appear as a new starting player ship class.</p>

<h2>Caveats, Warnings, and Disclaimers</h2>

<p>Transcendence is still in development and you will very likely find bugs and limitations in the data formats.</p>

<p>You may freely distribute the contents of this .zip file and you are free to create works that derive from the files here without limitation.</p>
