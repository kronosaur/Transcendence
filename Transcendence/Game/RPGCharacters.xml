<!-- CHARACTER SCREEN ==========================================================

	USAGE

	The object (generally a ship) with this screen must set the character 
	parameter on the class.

	The object must also define the following language elements:

		FirstMeetingIntro
		MeetingIntro
		NoMissions

	The character type must define the following static data elements:

		MissionAttribute: A string representing the attribute to use for all 
				missions that may be assigned by the character.

	The character type must define the following events:

		OnCharacterCanBeMet: If handled, the event may return True to indicate
				that the meeting should continue. Or the event may return a
				string to display declining the meeting.

-->

	<DockScreen UNID="&dsRPGCharacterDefault;"
			>
		<OnScreenInit>
			;	Make sure the player is allowed to talk to this character.

			(block (explanation)
				(switch
					;	If Nil, then the event is not handled so we continue meeting.

					(not (setq explanation (typFireObjEvent (objGetProperty gSource 'character) gSource 'OnCharacterCanBeMet)))
						True

					;	If True, then we are allowed to meet and continue.

					(eq explanation True)
						True

					;	Otherwise, we expect an explanation string.

					(scrShowScreen gScreen &dsRPGMessage; {
						desc: explanation
						nextScreen: 'forceUndock
						})

						;	If the player has never met the character, then we do a quick intro.

						(not (typGetData (objGetProperty gSource 'character) 'firstPlayerMeetingTime))

						;	Otherwise, the normal description

<!-- GLOBAL FUNCTIONS ==========================================================

	USAGE

	These functions use the following global variables on character types:

	firstPlayerMeetingTime: Tick of player's first meeting with character.
			Nil if the player has never met face to face.

	lastestPlayerMeetingTime: Tick of most recent meeting with character.

	lastNodeID: Character's last known position. Nil means unknown.

	lastSystemPos: Character's last known position in the lastNodeID system.

	objID: The objID of character's current ship. If Nil, then no ship has
			been created yet.

	playerRel: If Nil, character has never met the player. Positive numbers mean that
			character likes/trusts/respects the player. Negative numbers mean the
			opposite.

	screenData: This is a structure specifying the screen to show when the player
			interacts with the character. The struct has the following fields:

			screen: The screen to show
			pane: If non-Nil, the pane to navigate to
			data: If non-Nil, data to pass to the screen

			If this value is Nil, then we look for missions tagged with 
			character mission attribute (e.g., kateMorgentalMission).
