					"\"It's calm now, but I've been hearing a lot of military chatter lately.\""
					"\"Most people don't care where their metals come from, but let me tell you: plasteel doesn't grow in greenhouses! We have to struggle to mine enough for everyone.\""
					"\"Charon pirates have always been a problem here. They're getting stronger every year. One of these days we're going to have to do something about them.\""
					"\"The Korolov folks are good people; they're a little uptight about schedules and they're big on pomp and medals, but we get along pretty well.\""
					"\"We've had a lot of trouble with the warlords. They come through in gangs and shoot up the place; they take what they need and then leave.\""
					"\"So you're going to the Core, huh? Good luck with that! I've known a lot of people heading towards the Core. My best friend's wife left about a year ago. Can't say that anyone's ever returned, though.\""
					"\"I don't know much about weapons; not as much as you do, anyway. But I know a lot of people who favor the AK15 Partisan. Of course, if you can get your hands on a slam cannon, you're styling.\""
					"\"Heavy metal armor is the best, in my opinion. Ceramic is nice for my dishes, but it will do kack-all against a slam cannon. Ithalium is the best; orthosteel is pretty awesome too. Duralloy lasts almost forever, though.\""
					"\"Have you ever been to the Outer Realm? Out beyond the Sung Slavers, where the Ringers live? It's miner heaven, I bet. I'd like to go out there some day. Just me and a souped-up Borer. The Ferians are there too; I hear they've got mining techniques like you've never seen.\""
					"\"It's not too dangerous from Eridani to St. Kat's. Mostly just pirates to worry about. But deeper in the Ungoverned Territories there are dangers that you cannot imagine. Slavers will jump you out in deep space and boost your body for their slave farms.\""
					"\"The Charon pirates are nasty, but you can handle their gunships. Stay away from their frigates, though.\""
					"\"When a Charon frigate is out hunting you'd best get away. They'll take you down fast without so much as a warning.\""
					"\"Titanium ore is as common as suit-rash. Palladium and plasteel are kack too. If you want a good payday, find an asteroid with cerallox or helium regolith.\""
					"\"Every chump with a mining laser thinks he can mine. But if you want to be a serious miner you need a miner's cargo hold.\""
					"\"Volcanic asteroids are the best for mining. I once found 30 tons of ithalium ore on one! Kept me in vodka and cunnu for a couple of years!\""
					"\"Ice asteroids are filthy with cerallox. Lots of palladium and plasteel too, though, so they're not always worth the effort.\""
